/**
 * VETERINARY APPOINTMENT SYSTEM - RELATIONSHIP ANALYSIS
 * Updated after fixing dashboard filtering issues
 * 
 * ✅ FIXED IMPLEMENTATION:
 * 
 * 1. DOCTORS (1) ←→ TIME SLOTS (Many)
 *    ✅ Each doctor creates their own time slots
 *    ✅ TimeSlot.doctorId links to specific doctor
 *    ✅ Only available slots shown for selected doctor
 *    ✅ Doctor dashboard shows only their own available slots
 * 
 * 2. PATIENTS (Independent Registration)
 *    ✅ Patients register independently 
 *    ✅ Can choose any available veterinarian
 *    ✅ Multiple pets per patient
 *    ✅ Patient dashboard shows only their own appointments
 * 
 * 3. APPOINTMENTS (Many-to-1: Patient→Doctor)
 *    ✅ Each appointment links specific patient to specific doctor
 *    ✅ Appointment.doctorId + Appointment.clientEmail creates relationship
 *    ✅ Doctor dashboard: filters by apt.doctorId === doctor.id
 *    ✅ Patient dashboard: filters by apt.clientEmail === patient.email
 * 
 * 4. CHAT MESSAGES (Scoped to Appointment)
 *    ✅ ChatMessage.appointmentId links to specific appointment
 *    ✅ Only doctor and patient of that appointment can chat
 * 
 * RELATIONSHIP SUMMARY:
 * 
 * TIME SLOTS:
 * - Doctor creates slots → Only their patients can book those slots
 * - 1 Doctor : Many Time Slots (1:M)
 * 
 * PATIENTS & DOCTORS:
 * - Patients can book with any doctor (Many:Many through appointments)
 * - Each appointment creates a specific relationship
 * 
 * APPOINTMENTS:
 * - 1 Patient : Many Appointments (with different doctors)
 * - 1 Doctor : Many Appointments (with different patients)
 * - Each appointment is isolated and specific
 * 
 * CHAT:
 * - 1 Appointment : Many Chat Messages
 * - Only participants of that appointment can access chat
 * 
 * DATA ISOLATION:
 * ✅ Doctors only see their own appointments, slots, and patient chats
 * ✅ Patients only see their own appointments and chats with their doctors
 * ✅ Time slots are doctor-specific and properly filtered
 * ✅ No cross-contamination of data between doctors or patients
 * 
 * This is the CORRECT and SECURE model for a veterinary system!
